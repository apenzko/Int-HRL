Find the official repository for [Int-HRL: Towards Intention-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](https://collaborative-ai.org/publications/penzkofer24_ncaa/) at [https://git.hcics.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/public-projects/Int-HRL](https://git.hcics.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/public-projects/Int-HRL)<br> 

Int-HRL uses eye gaze from human demonstration data on the Atari game Montezuma's Revenge to extract human player's intentions and converts them to sub-goals for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). For further details take a look at the corresponding paper.
